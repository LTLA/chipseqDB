Description: Describes a computational workflow for performing a DB analysis with sliding windows.
        The aim is to facilitate the practical implementation of window-based DB analyses by providing detailed code and expected output.
        The workflow described here applies to any ChIP-seq experiment with multiple experimental conditions and multiple biological samples in one or more of the conditions.
        It detects and summarizes DB regions between conditions in a de novo manner, i.e., without making any prior assumptions about the location or width of bound regions.
        Detected regions are then annotated according to their proximity to genes.
